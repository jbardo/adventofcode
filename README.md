# Advent of Code

My solutions to a programming challenge made by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).

From the website:
>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.
